Excited by their discovery, Mia, Alex, and Lucas hurried back to the main arcade to share their findings with the other gamers. As they burst through the door, they were met with a mix of curiosity and skepticism from the other players. But as they recounted their journey through the hidden level and revealed the message they had uncovered, the room fell silent.

Slowly, the other gamers began to piece together the clues and revelations, realizing that Square Games was more than just a collection of fun arcade games.

Armed with their skills, determination, and newfound sense of camaraderie, they set out on a new adventure, ready to face whatever challenges came their way. The fate of the town depended on them, and they were more than ready to rise to the challenge.
