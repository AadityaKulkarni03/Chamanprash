In the bustling city of New York, there is a unique underground club known only to a selected few. The club is called "Toilet" and it is not your average night spot. Nestled hidden behind an unassuming door in an alleyway, "Toilet" is a haven for those seeking an escape from the mundane and ordinary. The club's reputation precedes it, with rumors swirling about the wild and outlandish parties that take place within its walls.

The owner of "Toilet" is a mysterious figure known only as Mr. Flush. He is a man of few words but his presence commands respect and awe from all who enter the club. Mr. Flush has a taste for the eccentric and the bizarre, curating a lineup of performers and acts that leave guests in a state of bewilderment and fascination. Some say he has a penchant for the avant-garde and the unconventional, always pushing the boundaries of what is considered acceptable.

For those lucky enough to secure an invitation to "Toilet," the experience is like stepping into a different dimension. The club is a sensory overload, with vibrant colors, pulsating music, and a cast of characters who defy societal norms. It is a place where inhibition is left at the door and guests are free to embrace their wildest fantasies and desires. But beneath the facade of extravagance and revelry lies a darkness that lurks within "Toilet," a secret that Mr. Flush guards carefully and only a chosen few are privy to.
