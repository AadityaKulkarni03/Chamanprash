Stephanie woke up in a daze, unsure of where she was or how she had gotten there. Everything felt blurry around the edges, like she was seeing the world through a foggy window. She tried to remember what had happened before she blacked out, but all she could recall was a fleeting image of a dark alley and a man with piercing blue eyes.

As Stephanie stumbled out of bed and headed towards the bathroom, she noticed something strange. The layout of her apartment seemed different, as if the walls had shifted overnight. She brushed it off as a trick of her tired mind, but the feeling of unease lingered. Was she going crazy or was someone messing with her?

As she splashed cold water on her face, a sudden knock on the door made her jump. She cautiously made her way to the entrance, her heart pounding in her chest. When she opened the door, she was met with a familiar face that sent chills down her spine. It was the man with the blue eyes from her memory, and he was holding a blood-stained knife. And that's when Stephanie realized that her life was about to take a twisted turn she never could have imagined.
